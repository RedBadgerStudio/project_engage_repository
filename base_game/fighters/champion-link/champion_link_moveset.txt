CHARACTER MOVESET CONCEPT SHEET

CHARACTER NAME: Link
FILENAME: champion-link

ARCHETYPE: mixup, zoner, trapper 

PHILOSOPHY: 
	Links design philosophy will reflect the gameplay of 'The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild',
	Links resources will be limited,but he is very skilled with the resources he has, making link be able to thrive in 
	battles with items enabled, while hes still easily able to take control of the situation in 1 on 1 no items. 
	that being said, link will be a fighter directed more casually, with advanced tec that will still makeing him very competativly viable.
	that being said, link suffers much more then any other fighter with repative use of his abilites, due to one of his gimmicks, making him very
	unspamable.


GIMICK:
	BREAKABLE WEAPONS: 
		Throughout the fight, links Master Sword, hylian Shield, and Travelers bow will take damage throughout the battle,
		if each weapon takes enough damage, it will break upon its last use, if links Master Sword breaks, he will be left with using a travelers
		sword, which does far less damage, far less range, muhc less health, and can't shoot sword beams.
		If that breaks, any moves using a sword will no longer be useable, if links Hylian shield breaks, he will resort to his travelers shield,
		which covers a smaller surface, not able to defend link from higher damage projectiles, completely unable to defend against melee
		attacks, and has less health, if that breaks, all of links shield based passive abilities, and shield based moves, will be unusable.
		If Links travelers bow breaks, link will no longer be able to use the bow, instead his nuetral special will changed completely.
		Link will regain all of his weapons after hos stock is cleared.
	

PASSIVE ABILITY:
	While Link has his shield out, Link recives a simular ability to bowsers tough guy, when facing an oponent, link ignores knockback and flinch
	of up to a certain amount, if the move directly hits his shield (for example, if link is hit by Marios Nair)
